I've sign up for the <a href = "hackvent.hacking-lab.com"> Hackvent event </a> made by the guys from <a href = "www.hacking-lab.com"> www.hacking-lab.com</a>, which is a advent-like hacking competition. Every day there is a new challenge posted at midnight which has a to solved at best in the same day, the challenge becoming increasingly more difficult every week completed. The aim in every puzzle is to find either a qr-encoded x-mas ball with lead to the validation code, or a secret human-readable string which gives you the former ball when feeding into a validator (the "Ball-O-Matic").

Here's the write-up for the fourth challenge, in which we will compare apples and oranges.
