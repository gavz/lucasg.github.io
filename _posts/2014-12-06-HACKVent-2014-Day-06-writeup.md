I've sign up for the <a href = "hackvent.hacking-lab.com"> Hackvent event </a> made by the guys from <a href = "www.hacking-lab.com"> www.hacking-lab.com</a>, which is a advent-like hacking competition. Every day there is a new challenge posted at midnight which has a to solved at best in the same day, the challenge becoming increasingly more difficult every week completed. The aim in every puzzle is to find either a qr-encoded x-mas ball with lead to the validation code, or a secret human-readable string which gives you the former ball when feeding into a validator (the "Ball-O-Matic").

Here's the write-up for the sixth challenge, which has been solved during a hangover.

For the Day 06 Hackvent challenge, we were given the following instructions :

![Riddle from hackvent.hacking-lab.com for Day 06](/assets/hackvent/06/riddle.png)

I instantanely recognized the <a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck" > Brainfuck language </a>, an estoric programming language that amuse a lot of people by the abstrusness of the code written in it. If you can acess an online interpreter, you don't even need to have a computer (I solved it only on my smartphone). The result : <code> There are only 10 types of people in the world: Those who understand binary, and those who don't </code>.
