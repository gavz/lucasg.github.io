Inkscape impossible build

For a project on Coursera, I though I would tweak a bit Inkscape to implement an algorithm based on layering. For that idea, I needed to build Inkscape from scratch, which reveals to be much harder than expected.

Step 0 : Fresh start

For that matter, I've booten up a fresh VM with a 64-bit Mint on it. Set up bzr, and retrieve inskcape source code. That's when the fun begins.

On the wiki (wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Compiliing_Inkscape) and (www.inkscape.org/en/develop/getting-started) it's quite straightforward : autogen, configure and make. Reality is quite different :p

Step 2 : autogen - First attempt

Well, I need the autotools. I figured I would had to install it, but it's not described in the documentation.

Step 2 : autogen - Second attempt

Same thing, but for intltoolize, which can be installed using sudo apt-get instal intltool & autopoint. 

Step 2 : autogen - Third attempt

Ok, I don't have missing lib anymore, and autogen seem to work, although it is outputing warnings about deprecated lines and automake seemed to have failed ! Whatever.

Step 3 : configure - First attempt

Ok, "C compiler cannot create executable" : wtf ?
Apparently this can be fixed by installing libc-dev package.

Step 3 : configure - Second attempt

A new error : LT_PREREQ is not recognized by the configuration script. That con be solved by installing the following packagess : autoconf libtool autoconf-archive

Step 3 : configure - Third attempt

New missing dependency : freetyp-config, which can be solved by installing libfreetype6-dev. Same thing littlecms  : sudo apt-get install liblcms2-dev.When re-executing configure, we obtain a number of package missing (as always).
